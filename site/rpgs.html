    <h1>Deep in the Heart of Hexas</h1>
    <p>Out here in the old west, life is hard. The baking sun, the back-breaking work and the ever present threat of
      unspeakable slime-covered tentacle monsters mean that making a living here is tougher than most. Lucky for us
      townsfolk a helpful but slightly shadowy and demonic passerby has granted the residents of this here town the
      ability to protect themselves for the teeny tiny itsy bitsy cost of ownership of their immortal soul for all
      eternity. Well, there ain’t time to sit around yapping so come on there’s work to be done. </p>

    <h1>Lambduh</h1>
    <p>Ah so this is it! You are now a graduate and it's your first day on the job at the National Erudite Research
      Department (NERD). Sure you never opened a textbook and cheated on your exams, but nobody ever actually needs the
      stuff they learn in school, right? Even then you picked up enough techno-babble to ace the interview so you sure
      sound like you know what you are talking about, and isn't that what the 'E' in NERD is all about? Maybe your luck
      will continue to hold and you won't be found out. I'm sure you'll just be making coffees anyway...</p>
